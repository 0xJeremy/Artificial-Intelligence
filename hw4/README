Usage:
	Running:
		~/$ python neural_net.py

To set data path:
	In the 'Parameter Variables' section at the top of the program, modify the 
	PATH variable to set the location of the iris dataset.

To optimize training:
	To potentially optimize the training of the neural network, change the
	random seed in the 'Paramater Variables' section at the top of the
	program. Some seeds perform significantly better than others.

Other Notes:
	This program has been proven to train with a 98% degree of accuracy.
	That said, it has also shown to train as poorly as <40% accuracy. If the 
	program trains with an accuracy under 70%, a prompt will appear informing
	the user and ask if they wish to train the set again.
