Usage:
	Running:
		~/$ python genetic.py

To modify input:
	To modify the input of the items in the knapsack, change the 'weights',
	'values', and 'max_capacity' values directly under the start of the
	main function.

The knapsack problem has been solved in this program using a genetic
algorithm. While it produces a good result to the problem posed,
it does not always find an optimal solution. For example, in the test
input, the optimal solution has a value of 20. However, this program
will occasionally find solutions of value 17, or 18, or 19. Should
this happen, run the program again and it will likely produce a
result of 20.
