Usage:
	Running:
		~/$ python genetic.py

To modify input:
	To modify the input of the items in the knapsack, change the 'weights',
	'values', and 'max_capacity' values directly under the start of the
	main function.
To show more information:
	By default the program only shows the most fit chromosome from each
	generation. To change this and print every chromosome, modify the 
	variable 'DISPLAY_MORE_INFO' on line 16.
To optimize algorithm:
	At the top of the program under "Constant Variables" is a list of
	constants used in the program. Changing these will modify the
	success of the algorithm. These values have been chosen because
	they appear to optimize the result of the genetic algorithm, but
	may not be fully optimize. Changing these values may increase
	the success of the genetic algorithm.

The knapsack problem has been solved in this program using a genetic
algorithm. While it produces a good result to the problem posed,
it does not always find an optimal solution. For example, in the test
input, the optimal solution has a value of 20. However, this program
will occasionally find solutions of value 17, or 18, or 19. Should
this happen, run the program again and it will likely produce a
result of 20.
