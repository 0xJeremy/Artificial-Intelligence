Usage:
	Required modules:
		Itertools: ~/$ pip install itertools
	Running:
		~/$ python sudoku.py

To modify input:
	The modify the input of the original sudoku board, change the 'board' 
	variable directly under the start of the main function. For any square 
	that is blank, enter 0. Three defaults have already been entered: the easy 
	and hard boards provided in the assignment, and another more difficult 
	board found on the internet.

Solving a sudoku puzzle has been defined in this program as a constraint 
satisfaction problem. This program makes use of the AC-3 algorithm (Arc 
Consistency 3 algorithm). The heuristics it implements are Backtracking and 
Forward Checking.
