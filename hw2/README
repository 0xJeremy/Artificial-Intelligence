Usage:
	Required modules:
		Itertools: ~/$ pip install itertools
	Running:
		~/$ python sudoku.py

To modify input:
	The modify the input of the original sudoku board, change the 
	'board' variable directly under the start of the main function. 
	For any square that is blank, enter 0. Three defaults have 
	already been entered: the easy and hard boards provided in the 
	assignment, and another more difficult board found on the 
	internet.

Solving a sudoku puzzle has been defined in this program as a 
constraint satisfaction problem. This program makes use of the AC-3 
algorithm (Arc Consistency 3 algorithm). The heuristics it 
implements are Backtracking and Forward Checking.
